I used the following websites to look up certain functions in VBA:

	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3244863/getting-the-number-of-filled-cells-in-a-column-vba

	for the "usedRange" Format of finding the total number of rows


	https://excelhelphq.com/how-to-loop-through-worksheets-in-a-workbook-in-excel-vba/

	for looping through the worksheets



	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.range.autofit

	for the autofit method for the columns



	https://excelvbatutor.com/vba_lesson9.htm

	for the formatting on the percent cells in the percent change columns



And I received one piece of help from Ryan Cornelius on the Range.Numberformat for the yearly change column
